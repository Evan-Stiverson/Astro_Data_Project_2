# Astro_Data_Project_2
# Exoplanet Explorer with AI Assistant

An intelligent query system for exploring NASA's exoplanet database using natural language.

## Description

This project uses AI and Pandas to analyze over 5,000 confirmed exoplanets from NASA's Exoplanet Archive. Users can ask natural language questions and receive data-driven answers powered by Claude AI with function calling.

## Features

- Natural language query interface
- Real-time data from NASA Exoplanet Archive
- 5 specialized search functions (mass, radius, temperature, hot Jupiters, Earth-like)
- Interactive visualization of planet distributions
- Works with or without API key

## Installation
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib anthropic
```

## Setup

### With API Key (Full Features)
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. When prompted in the notebook, enter your key (it will be hidden)

### Without API Key
The system runs in demo mode with pre-built queries.

## Usage

Open `Project2_Stiverson.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

**Example queries:**
- "Find all hot Jupiters"
- "Which planets could have liquid water?"
- "Show me planets similar to Earth"
